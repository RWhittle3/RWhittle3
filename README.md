### Introducting myself ðŸ˜ƒ

I work professionally as a technical program manager based in southern California (Orange County).  I have also managed Investment Banking IT teams in New York and London.  

Areas of professional interest include:
- Scaled agile methodologies (and how to tailor them to the specific needs of the client and the project).
- IT Management and strategy
- Program Governance and stakeholder management
- Cloud technologies
- Software development process improvement


Currently also learning ...
- Jira (and other emerging project management technologies)
- Teaching math (and possibly game development) to my 4th grader
- Reading <B>Lean Software Development.</B> by Mary Poppendieck

My software development experience:
-  Worked for several years automating Microsoft office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) to increase the productivity of investment bankers working in New York and London.  Technically, this is my best work.  Tens of billions of dollars of business has been pitched using my pitchbooks.  I am doing less of this recently, and most of that code is highly proprietary (hard to share here).
-  Rally customization to support scaled agile.  (Rally Web App development, using the Rally SDK and ExtJS)
